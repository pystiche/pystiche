# pystiche

The pystiche project is a free, open-source framework for Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithms. Roughly speaking, pystiche relates to NST algorithms as PyTorch relates to deep learning.

The name of the project is a pun on [_pastiche_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche) meaning:

> A pastiche is a work of visual art [...] that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists. Unlike parody, pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.

# Installation

`pystiche` requires `python 3.6` or later. Make sure you install `torch` and `torchvision` from the [official sources](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) in order to avoid any installation errors.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmeier/pystiche
pip install pystiche/
```

# Demo 

You can find some demo scripts in the `demo` folder. Head over to our [sister repository `pystiche_replication`](https://github.com/pmeier/pystiche_replication) for the implementation of famous scientific papers within the field of NST.
