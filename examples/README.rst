``pystiche`` usage examples
===========================

.. note::

  Although a GPU is not a requirement, it is strongly advised to run these examples
  with one. The total execution times at the bottom of each example are calculated by
  executing them on a GPU. If you don't have access to one, the execution time might
  increase by multiple orders of magnitude.
